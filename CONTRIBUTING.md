# Contributing

Want to contribute to the this project? Great! First, read this page.

## Code of conduct

Contributing code to a community is a great way to engage. Make sure to read our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); the foundation for our community interactions.

## Individual contributions

Before we can use your code, you must sign Toitware's
[individual contributor license agreement](https://github.com/toitlang/toit/blob/master/CLA.md) (CLA).
Toitware is the startup company that originally developed
the Toit language and it continues to be the maintainer of the associated open source projects. Requiring a CLA
is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. Major open source projects require CLAs
such as Apache Software Foundation projects, Facebook projects (such as React), Google projects (including Go),
Python, Django, and more.

The CLA is based on [Google's CLA for individuals](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual), which in return
is based on the [Apache CLA for individuals](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf). Send an email
to [open-source@toit.io](mailto:open-source@toit.io) indicating your request to sign the
CLA and we will respond with a document ready for your electronic signature. Please include a link to your GitHub
user profile page in the request to make it easier to identify your contributions going forward.

The CLA makes it explicit that contributions are licensed under the project's respective open source licenses,
that contributors give permission to use the contributions indefinitely, and provides Toitware the right to
include the contributions in commercial products. The license also makes clear that contributors are not assuming
any warranty or support obligations for any contributions. Agreeing to the CLA is not a transfer of ownership.
You do not lose or change any of your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contributions become part of
our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various
other things - for instance that you‘ll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people’s
patents. Importantly, the CLA also gives Toitware the right to **sublicense** your contributions, which means that
Toitware can use your work in commercial products and distribute them under other licenses, including proprietary
ones; see [dual licensing](#dual-licensing).

You don‘t have to sign the CLA until after you’ve submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a
larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that
we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later
on.

### Dual licensing

Toitware uses the Toit programming language and its open source implementation to build the
full [Toit platform](https://toit.io). The Toit platform is a closed source derivative of the open source
code base and it is licensed under a [proprietary commercial license](https://toit.io/terms-of-service).
This implies that the language implementation uses [dual licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing)
since the same code is offered under two different licences. By granting Toitware the right to sublicense your
contributions, the CLA ensures that Toitware can continue to use this setup to build a business around the Toit language.


## Corporate contributions

Contributions made by corporations will be covered by a different agreement than the one above. If you work
for a corporation, do let us know up front so we can get the right agreement in place.
